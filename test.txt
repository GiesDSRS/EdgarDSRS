Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm’s report contains a statement that our net loss and limited working capital raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accountants have stated in their report (included in Item 8. Financial Statements) that our significant operating losses and working capital deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We incurred net income of $1,221 for the year ended June 30, 2021 and net loss of $2,477,557 during the year ended June 30, 2020. Although the Company continues to rely on equity and debt investors to finance its losses, it is implementing plans to achieve cost savings and other strategic objectives to address Company profitability. In addition to raising debt and equity financing, the Company continues to focus on growing the subsidiaries anticipated to be most profitable while reducing investments in areas that are not expected to have long-term benefits. The Company will continue to pursue synergistic opportunities to enhance its business portfolio. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth the results of our operations for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 : 6 Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 Revenues $ 3,406,684 $ 1,178,154 Cost of revenues 2,471,966 625,916 Gross profit 934,718 552,238 Operating expenses 9,504,869 3,241,335 Loss from operations (8,570,151 ) (2,689,097 ) Other income (expenses) 8,571,372 211,540 Net income (loss) $ 1,221 $ (2,477,557 ) Revenues and Cost of Revenues Revenues as attributable to each entity were as follows: Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 Prakat $ 1,185,981 $ 586,780 Precision 150,060 146,887 Pacific Stem 652,130 – Health 514,005 407,069 Likido 331,254 – IHG 452,246 – Shark 121,008 37,418 $ 3,406,684 $ 1,178,154 The acquisition of Prakat occurred in January 2020, and revenue was generated from the date of acquisition until June 30, 2020, whereas for fiscal 2021, revenue was recorded for an entire fiscal year. Dalrada Health’s sales activity picked up in 2020 when the Company acquired Shark Technologies and launched its GlanHealth product line. The acquisition of Shark Technologies occurred in March of 2020, and revenue was generated from the date of acquisition until June 30, 2020, whereas for fiscal 2021, revenue was recorded for an entire fiscal year. Likido’s revenue increased during 2021 as it was primarily an R&D entity during fiscal 2020. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $9,504,869 compared to operating expenses of $3,241,335 during the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $6,263,534. The increase in operating expenses was due to an increase in the operating activity as most of fiscal 2020 was spent on the continuing development of the Company’s proposed business operations. The increase was also partially attributable to non-cash stock compensation, the continued development and commercialization of the Likido operation and new business units. 7 Other Income (Expense) During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $670,272 and $768,361, respectively, of penalties and interest within interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. For years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $9,504,041 and $1,229,199, respectively, within “Gain on expiration of accrued payroll taxes” as a result of quarterly tax liabilities that expired during the fiscal years. Net Income (Loss) Net income for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $1,221 compared to a net loss of $2,477,557 during the year ended June 30, 2020. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, 2021, the Company had current assets of $1,640,511 and current liabilities of $17,264,374 compared with current assets of $1,251,537 and current liabilities of $17,029,243 at June 30, 2020. The decrease in the working capital deficit was due to the fact that the Company recovered tax liability during the year which was used to offset outstanding obligations. Cash presently on hand is immaterial. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the successful financing through equity and/or debt investors and growing the subsidiaries anticipated to be profitable while reducing investments in areas that are not expected to have long-term benefits. The Company anticipates an increase in sales through the commercialization of the Likido heating and cooling units, the expansion of Prakat’s technology services, IHG’s increased educational footprint, additional GlanHealth sales channels and other new business opportunities (see “Subsequent Events”). These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The increase in the use of cash for operating activities was primarily due to an overall increase in day-to-day operating costs while the Company continues to grow in addition to its new business units. 8 Cash flow from Investing Activities During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company purchased equipment for $357,691.

The JV, Pala Diagnostics, LLC ("Pala") is a CLIA-certified diagnostics lab focused on SARS-CoV-2 testing for now with additional testing capabilities to be introduced. Pursuant to the partnership agreement, Dalrada had an equity commitment of $500,000 of which it achieved during September 2021. Dalrada has invested additional funding to continue the expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 testing while commercial insurance and CARES Act reimbursements process claims. Since fiscal year-end, Pala has conducted over 25,000 tests. As part of the JV, Dalrada shall also issue two hundred and fifty thousand common shares (250,000) to Vivera. Subsequent to year-end, the Company borrowed $366,263 from Related Entity 1, and borrowed $2,206,718 from Related Entity 3. 9 Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in note (1) of the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. Accrued Payroll Taxes The total balance for Federal Accrued Payroll Taxes is accumulated on a quarterly basis beginning on their respective quarterly filing dates. Accrued Interest is compounded daily at an Effective Annual Interest Rate of approximately seven percent. The individual quarterly sub-totals have a calculated expiration date of Ten years according to the Internal Revenue Service statute of limitations. This timeline can be extended as a result of bankruptcy or other legal action that is filed by the company (Code 520 per IRS Federal Account Transcripts). Code 520 effectively stops the clock for the Statute of limitations until the Bankruptcy or other legal action has been removed (Code 521 per IRS Federal Account Transcripts). In addition to the number of days between Code 520 and 521, every Code 520 automatically extends the IRS Statute of limitations by 30 days. As the quarterly sub-totals surpass their respective “Calculated Expiration Date” the company removes the liability from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and an equivalent amount is recognized as “Gain on expiration of accrued payroll taxes” on the Statements of Operations. The amount owing may be subject to additional late filing fees and penalties that are not quantifiable as at the date of these consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes and accounts for revenue in accordance with ASC 606 as a principal on the sale of goods. Pursuant to ASC 606, revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and related public and private sector policies and initiatives. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. A couple key categories that use estimates are Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Impairment. Stock-Based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation , using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value using quoted market prices of the equity instruments issued. 10 Business Combination ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations to all acquisitions where the acquirer gains a controlling interest, regardless of whether consideration was exchanged. ASC 805 establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: a) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and c) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. Accounting for acquisitions requires the Company to recognize, separately from goodwill, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”). ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives should be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (June 30 for the Company) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company considers its market capitalization and the carrying value of its assets and liabilities, including goodwill, when performing its goodwill impairment test. When conducting its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company initially performs a qualitative evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. If it is determined by a qualitative evaluation that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, the Company then applies a two-step impairment test. The two-step impairment test first compares the fair value of the Company's reporting unit to its carrying or book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company determines the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. There was no impairment of goodwill as of June 30, 2021. An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. Separable assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, etc. Examples of intangible assets include computer software, licenses, trademarks, patents, films and copyrights. The Company’s intangible assets are finite lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Purchase Price Allocation Upon the completion of a business combination, the consideration transferred as well as the assets and liabilities acquired must be recorded at their acquisition date fair values. Upon identification of the acquirer and determination of the acquisition date, business combinations are accounted for through the preparation of a Purchase Price Allocation (PPA). We take into consideration the five steps when completing a PPA: Step 1: Determine the fair value of consideration paid; Step 2: Revalue all existing assets and liabilities (excluding intangible assets and goodwill which are addressed in step 3 to 5 below) to their acquisition date fair values; Step 3: Identify the intangible assets acquired; Step 4: Determine the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired; and, Step 5: Allocate the remaining consideration to goodwill and assess the reasonableness of the overall 11 Related Party Transactions Related party transactions are conducted with parties with which DFCO has a close association, such as majority owned subsidiaries, its executive, managers, and their families. The types of transactions that can be conducted between related parties are many, such as sales, asset transfers, leases, lending arrangements, guarantees, allocations of common costs, and the filing of consolidated tax returns. DFCO discloses any transaction that would impact the decision making of the users of a company’s financial statements. This involves the following disclosures: · General. DFCO discloses all material related party transactions, including the nature of the relationship, the nature of the transactions, the dollar amounts of the transactions, the amounts due to or from related parties. · Receivables. DFCO separately discloses any receivables from officers, employees, or affiliated entities. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . The amendments in this Update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this pronouncement on July 1, 2020, and there was not a material impact on the financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity, and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the “if-converted” method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Company’s current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2020-06 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures. We have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company. Contractual Obligations We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 12 Item 8. Financial Statements DALRADA FINANCIAL CORPORATION Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 14 Consolidated Balance Sheets 16 Consolidated Statements of Operations 17 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Deficit 18 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 19 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 20 13 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Dalrada Financial Corporation Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dalrada Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (collectively the “Company”) as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows, for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has had recurring losses, used cash flows from operating activities and has a significant working capital deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 14 Related Party Transactions including Revenue Recognition Description of the Matter: As discussed in Notes 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has significant related party transactions involving revenue, accounts receivable, accounts payable, loans payable, advances, and expenses paid by and to multiple related parties. Our auditing of management’s identification of related parties and the related transactions including recognition of revenue was complex and is based on a thorough understanding the Company’s related party relationships, contracts, and business activities. These were the principal considerations that led us to determine this as a critical audit matter. How We Addressed the Matter in our Audit: We evaluated the controls over the Company’s identification of, and recording of related party transactions, and of the revenue recognition process, including walkthroughs. We confirmed certain balances and transactions with related parties. To evaluate the related party’s satisfaction of performance obligations, our audit procedures included, among others, reviewing contracts and evaluating management’s assumptions used to determine the distinct performance obligations, and reviewing the branding work performed by the Company for various products. In addition, to identify undisclosed related party transactions we performed the following: 1) made inquiries of management and other individuals throughout the Company; 2) obtained a selection of expenses and reviewed for related party indicators; 3) reviewed public filings and other online information available; 4) confirmed with the transfer agent regarding significant shareholders; and 5) related procedures performed in other parts of the audit engagement. Revenue Recognition Description of the Matter: As disclosed in Note 2, 8 and 11, the Company recognizes revenue when or as the Company satisfies a customer agreement performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. In determining revenue recognition for certain customer agreements, significant judgment was exercised by the Company, and included the following: 1) An assessment of the products and services promised in contracts or customer agreements, and the identification of a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a product or service that is distinct. 2) Determination of relative standalone selling price for distinct performance obligations. 3) The timing of product or service delivery for performance obligations. Given these factors, the related audit effort in evaluating management’s judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive, which led us to determine this as a critical audit matter How We Addressed the Matter in our Audit: Our principal audit procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition for these customer agreements included an evaluation of the controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations and the determination of the timing of revenue recognition. We also evaluated management’s significant accounting policies related to certain customer agreements. In addition, we selected customer agreements and performed the following procedures: 1) Obtained and read the customer agreements or contracts for each selected agreement. 2) Evaluated and tested management’s identification of significant terms for completeness, including the identification of distinct performance obligations. 3) Evaluated the appropriateness of management’s application of their accounting principles, in their determination of revenue recognition conclusions. 4) Tested he mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the consolidated financial statements. /s/ dbb mckennon We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.

IHG provides highly trained nursing and medical assistants for hospitals and home health facilities since 2006. IHG Medical Assistant programs include CNA (“Certified Nursing Assistant”) and HHA (“Home Health Aide”) training and the fast-track 22-Day CNA Certification Program at its state-approved testing facility. On February 3, 2021, Dalrada Health entered into a unit purchase agreement and acquired one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding membership units of Pacific Stem Cells, LLC, a California limited liability company (“Pacific Stem”). The purchase price consideration is approximately $352,000 in cash and 1,000,000 common shares of DFCO, with 300,000 shares to be released upon closing and the remaining 700,000 shares released quarterly over the course of twenty-four months. Pacific Stem provides regenerative therapy as a potential solution for the prevention, detection, and treatment of cellular breakdown associated with aging and a variety of other conditions. On April 21, 2021, the Company closed the transaction by moving into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement to acquire Ignite IT LLC (“Ignite”). The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests, including business plans and access to contacts of Ignite. In consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued a promissory note for $20,000. In June 2021, the Company launched Empower Genomics (“Empower”) to enter the genetic testing industry. Empower facilitates the manufacturing, filing, labeling, testing and reporting of genetics. The Company's principal executive offices are located at 600 La Terraza Blvd., Escondido, California 92025. Going Concern These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As at June 30, 2021, the Company had a working capital deficit of $15,623,863 and an accumulated deficit of $107,338,174. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the successful financing through equity and/or debt investors and growing the subsidiaries anticipated to be profitable while reducing investments in areas that are not expected to have long-term benefits. The Company anticipates an increase in sales through the commercialization of the Likido heating and cooling units, the expansion of Prakat’s technology services, IHG’s increased educational footprint, additional GlanHealth sales channels and other new business opportunities (see “Subsequent Events”). These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”) and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company’s fiscal year end is June 30. (b) Principles of Consolidation These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Dalrada Precision, a company incorporated in the State of California, since June 25, 2018 (date of incorporation), Dalrada Health, a company incorporated in the State of California, since October 2, 2018 (date of incorporation), as well as its subsidiaries (Likido, Prakat, Shark, IHG, Pacific Stem, Ignite, Empower) since their respective acquisition dates (see Note 3). All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation. 21 (c) Use of Estimates The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the valuation of inventory, valuation of accrued payroll tax liabilities, valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, variables used in the computation of share-based compensation, and evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. (d) Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. (e) Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company generally maintains balances in various operating accounts at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality, in amounts that may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to its cash and cash equivalents and does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. During the year ended June 30, 2021, there were no customers whose revenues accounted for 10% or greater of total revenues. During the year ended June 30, 2020, two customers accounted for approximately 16% and 11% of total revenues, respectively. (f) Fair Value Measurements Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Level 3 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, notes payable, and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations. 22 (g) Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are derived from products and services delivered to customers and are stated at their net realizable value. Each month, the Company reviews its receivables on a basis and evaluates whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary based on any known or perceived collection issues. Any balances that are eventually deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had an allowance of doubtful accounts of $37,465 and $0, respectively. (h) Inventory Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in first-out basis. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, inventory is comprised of raw materials purchased from suppliers, and finished goods produced or purchased for resale. The Company establishes inventory reserves for estimated obsolete or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future market conditions. (i) Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset, as follows: Estimated Useful Life Computer and office equipment 3 - 5 years Machinery and equipment 5 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of lease term or useful life Estimated useful lives are periodically assessed to determine if changes are appropriate. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of these assets and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the balance sheet and any resulting gains or losses are included in the statement of operations loss in the period of disposal. (j) Business Combinations and Acquisitions The Company accounts for acquisitions in which it obtains control of one or more businesses as a business combination. The purchase price of the acquired businesses is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recognized as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments, in the period in which they are determined, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. If the assets acquired are not a business, the Company accounts for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, the Company recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. In addition, for transactions that are business combinations, the Company evaluates the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. 23 (k) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews its long-lived assets (property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill is tested annually at June 30 for impairment and upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The annual goodwill impairment test allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. An entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to step one of the quantitative impairment test. If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of a reporting unit is, more likely than not, less than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is required. The quantitative impairment test calculates any goodwill impairment as the difference between the carrying amount of a reporting unit and its fair value, but not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. As of June 30, 2021, there were qualitative factors that indicated goodwill was impaired, but after completing the quantitative assessment it was determined that goodwill did not need to be impaired. An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. Separable assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, etc. Examples of intangible assets include computer software, licenses, trademarks, patents, films and copyrights. The Company’s intangible assets are finite lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. (l) Revenue Recognition The Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , and its related amendments (collectively known as “ASC 606”), effective January 1, 2019. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: - Identification of a contract with a customer; - Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; - Determination of the transaction price; - Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and - Recognition of revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. The Company’s revenue is derived from the sales of its products, which represents net sales recorded in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. Product sales are recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with the customer are satisfied. Typically, this would occur upon transfer of control, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods. The Company measures revenue as the amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods (transaction price). The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. The Company bases its estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns, markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by the Company. The actual amount of customer returns and allowances is inherently uncertain and may differ from the Company’s estimates. If the Company determines that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves it established, it would record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period in which it makes such a determination. Reserves for returns, and markdowns are included within accrued expenses and other liabilities. Allowance and discounts are recorded in accounts receivable, net and the value of inventory associated with reserves for sales returns are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 24 The Company estimates warranty claims reserves based on historical results and research and determined that a warranty reserve was not necessary as of June 30, 2021 or 2020. The Company also earns service revenue from its other subsidiaries, including information technology and consulting services via Prakat, educational programs and courses via IHG, and stem cell therapy procedures from Pacific Stems. For Prakat and Pacific Stems, revenues are recognized when performance obligations have been satisfied and the services are complete. This is generally at a point of time upon written completion and client acceptance of the project, which represents transfer of control to the customer. For IHG, revenues are recognized over the course of a semester while services are performed. During the fiscal year, the Company sold Likido units to its third-party manufacturer for testing purposes and for further resale to their customers. As of June 30, 2021, the Company changed its relationship exclusively to that of a third-party manufacturer and requested the title of inventory to be returned and adjusted the revenue accordingly. Deferred Revenue : ASC 606 requires disclosure of the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period and an explanation of when the entity expects to recognize revenue by either a quantitative basis or a qualitative basis. Deferred revenue for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $219,999 compared to $176,291 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The current year balance of $219,999 consists of deliverables from the following entities: $140,199 for IHG, $59,800 for Precision, and $20,000 for Prakat USA. It is anticipated that these products will be delivered during the first quarter of 2022. The prior year balance of $176,291 was for Likido products. Disaggregation of Revenue The following table presents the Company's revenue disaggregated by revenue source: Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 Product sales - third parties $ 1,053,720 $ 466,946 Product sales - related party 62,607 124,427 Service revenue - third parties 2,020,307 487,642 Service revenue - related party 270,050 99,139 Total revenue $ 3,406,684 $ 1,178,154 25 Contract Balances The following table provides information about receivables and contract liabilities from contracts with customers: June 30, 2021 2020 Accounts receivable, net $ 265,812 $ 229,167 Accounts receivable, net - related parties 69,952 99,357 Deferred revenue 219,999 176,291 The Company invoices customers based upon contractual billing schedules, and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent a set-up fee prepayment received from a customer in advance of performance obligations met. (m) Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of inventory sold and related freight for product sales and direct labor for information technology and consulting services. The following table is a breakdown of cost of revenue: June 30, 2021 2020 Product sales $ 1,331,329 $ 268,526 Service revenue 1,140,637 357,390 Total cost of revenue $ 2,471,966 $ 625,916 (n) Advertising Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, advertising expenses were approximately $563,907 and $34,000, respectively. (o) Stock-based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the quoted market price of the equity instruments issued. During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, stock-based compensation expenses were approximately $801,672 and $0, respectively. (p) Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar. The functional currency of the Likido subsidiary is the British pound. The functional currency of Prakat is the Indian rupee. The financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries were translated to United States dollars in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Translation Matters , using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the year for revenues and expenses. Gains and losses arising on foreign currency denominated transactions are included in condensed consolidated statements of operations. 26 (q) Comprehensive Income (Loss) ASC 220, Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the condensed consolidated financial statements. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company’s only component of comprehensive income was foreign currency translation adjustments. (r) Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share . ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the periods using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the periods is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. The weighted average number of common stock equivalents related to convertible notes payable of 56,801,471 shares was not included in diluted loss per share, because the effects are antidilutive, for the year ended June 30, 2020. In accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share”, the following table reconciles basic shares outstanding to fully diluted shares outstanding for the year ended June 30, 2021: Year Ended June 30, 2021 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Basic 70,318,073 Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents (convertible note payable - related party and accrued interest) 58,628,294 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Diluted 128,946,367 The adjustments to the numerator were insignificant during the year ended June 30, 2021 and there were no adjustments to the numerator during the year ended June 30, 2020. (s) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes . The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 27 (t) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . The amendments in this Update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this pronouncement on July 1, 2020, and there was not a material impact on the financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity, and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the “if-converted” method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Company’s current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2020-06 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures. The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 3. Business Combinations and Acquisition Fiscal 2021 Transactions International Health Group, Inc. (“IHG”) Effective January 29, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of IHG. In consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its common stock at $0.44 per share, or a total fair value of $440,000. The Company acquired IHG to expand into the educational sector of the Health and Human Services Industry. The International Health Group transaction was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). The Company has determined preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These values are subject to change as we perform additional reviews of our assumptions utilized. 28 The Company has made a preliminary allocation of the purchase price in regard to the acquisition related to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests as of the purchase date. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation: Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation Cash and cash equivalents $ 43,617 Accounts receivable 37,905 Other receivables 3,000 Property and equipment, net 3,930 Intangible assets 693,385 Accounts payable (32,093 ) Accrued liabilities (38,726 ) Deferred revenue (37,339 ) Notes payable (233,679 ) Purchase price consideration $ 440,000 The intangible assets for IHG are in the form of its curriculum development and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over its determined useful life of ten years for the following reasons: 1) The International Health Group transaction was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). 2) IHG’s founder initially started the program approximately ten years ago offering a Certified Nurse’s Assistant Program (CNA), thus giving the intangible asset a minimum of a 10-year useful. 3) Under US GAAP, the cost of intangible assets is either amortized over their respective useful/legal lives, or are tested for impairment on an annual basis. Pursuant to the costs incurred over a ten-year period to develop the CNA and other curriculums, the Company has determined a minimum of a 10-year useful life is appropriate. Pacific Stem Cells, LLC (“Pacific Stem”) Effective February 3, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the membership units of Pacific Stem. In consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued $352,650 in cash consideration and issued 1,000,000 shares of its common stock at $0.354 per share for a total fair value of $706,650. The Company acquired Pacific Stem as an opportunity to enter the growing alternative Health and Human Services Industry. The Pacific Stem Cells transaction was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). The Company has determined preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These values are subject to change as we perform additional reviews of our assumptions utilized. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the go-to-market synergies that are expected to arise as a result of the acquisition. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. 29 The Company has made a preliminary allocation of the purchase price in regard to the acquisition related to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests as of the purchase date. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation: Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation Cash and cash equivalents $ 281,164 Goodwill 593,304 Accounts payable (17,918 ) Notes payable (149,900 ) Purchase price consideration $ 706,650 Ignite On April 21, 2021, the Company closed the transaction by moving into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement to acquire Ignite IT LLC (“Ignite”). The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests, including business plans and access to contacts of Ignite. In consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued a promissory note for $20,000. The Company evaluated the acquisition of the purchased assets under ASC 805 and concluded that as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in an identifiable group of similar assets, the transaction did not meet the requirements to be accounted for as a business combination and therefore was accounted for as an asset acquisition. Accordingly, the Company recorded t he acquired research and development at a fair value of $20,000 as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Fiscal 2020 Transactions Likido Effective December 6, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the interests of Likido. In consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued 6,118,000 shares of its common stock at $0.0448 per share, or a total fair value of $274,086. The Likido transaction was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). The Company has determined preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These values are subject to change as we perform additional reviews of our assumptions utilized. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the go-to-market synergies that are expected to arise as a result of the acquisition. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. 30 The Company has made an allocation of the purchase price in regard to the acquisition related to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as of the purchase date.

Commitments and Contingencies Lease Commitments The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. This determination generally depends on whether the arrangement conveys to the Company the right to control the use of an explicitly or implicitly identified fixed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control of an underlying asset is conveyed to the Company if the Company obtains the rights to direct the use of and to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from using the underlying asset. The Company has lease agreements which include lease and non-lease components, which the Company has elected to account for as a single lease component for all classes of underlying assets. Lease expense for variable lease components is recognized when the obligation is probable. 39 Operating lease right of use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company primarily leases buildings (real estate) which are classified as operating leases. ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As an implicit interest rate is not readily determinable in the Company's leases, the incremental borrowing rate is used based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The lease term for all of the Company's leases includes the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by the lessor. Options for lease renewals have been excluded from the lease term (and lease liability) for the majority of the Company's leases as the reasonably certain threshold is not met. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are comprised of fixed payments, variable payments that depend on index or rate, and amounts probable to be payable under the exercise of the Company option to purchase the underlying asset if reasonably certain. Variable lease payments not dependent on a rate or index associated with the Company's leases are recognized when the event, activity, or circumstance in the lease agreement on which those payments are assessed as probable. Variable lease payments are presented as operating expenses in the Company's income statement in the same line item as expense arising from fixed lease payments. As of and during the year ended June 30, 2021, management determined that there were no variable lease costs. Right of Use Asset In May 2020, the Company entered into a five-year lease agreement to lease a commercial building in Escondido, California. The building is owned by a related party.

The lease agreements mature in April 2025. Total amounts expensed under the lease during the year ended June 20, 2021 and 2020 were $45,329 and $13,748, respectively. The Company’s Prakat subsidiary entered into a lease agreement to lease office space through September 2026.

In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities. The tax years ending 2018 through 2020 remain subject to examination for federal tax purposes and remain subject to examination in significant state tax jurisdictions. The Company has yet to file their income tax return for the year ended June 30, 2021 As of June 30, 2021, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of $20,036,664 that may be offset against future taxable income which will begin to expire in 2038 through 2041. The reconciliation of income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the income tax provision for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: 2021 2020 Current: Federal $ – $ – State 2,400 – Foreign – – 2,400 – Deferred: Federal (1,607,556 ) (522,084 ) State (446,626 ) (145,050 ) (2,054,182 ) (667,134 ) Valuation allowance 2,054,182 667,134 Total provision for income taxes $ 2,400 $ – 41 The provision for income tax for the year ended June 30, 2021 is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of: (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes; and (b) operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and our CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by the Annual Report were not effective and that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and our CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our CEO and our CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework. Based on this evaluation, our management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO, concluded that, as of June 30, 2021, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the CFO determined that Management's assessment of the effectiveness of the registrant's internal control over financial reporting is as of the year ended June 30, 2021. The Company believes that internal control over financial reporting is not effective. We and our independent registered public accounting firm have identified the following current material weakness, which some were first identified at June 30, 2020 and others identified as June 30, 2021, considering the nature and extent of our current operations and any risks or errors in financial reporting under current operations: • Lack of Management oversight and review of the financial reporting process, including presentation of the financial statements and related disclosures; • Lack of procedures related to recognition of revenues; • Lack of procedures related to the allocation of the purchase price, including acquired intangibles, in connection with business acquisitions. In May 2021, the Company the hired a CFO who is expected to develop policies and procedures to mitigate the indicated weaknesses. The Company expect to be begin implementing procedures in early fiscal 2022. 44 This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding our internal controls over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report. No Attestation Report by Independent Registered Accountant The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021 has not been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm by virtue of our exemption from such requirement as a smaller reporting company. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting except as noted above. Item 9B. Other Information.

However, with respect to the definition of independence utilized by NASDAQ, our officers and directors would be deemed to be independent. Our Audit Committee is comprised of our officers and directors. NASDAQ requires at least three members on the Audit Committee, each of whom must be independent. NASDAQ also requires that, if its Chief Executive Officer’s compensation is determined by its Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee must be comprised solely of independent directors. The Company currently does not meet either of these requirements. 54 The NASDAQ rules have both objective tests and a subjective test for determining who is an “independent director.” The objective tests state, for example, that a director is not considered independent if he or she is an employee of the Company or is a partner, executive officer or controlling stockholder of an entity to which the company made, or from which the Company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed the greater of $200,000 or 5% of the recipient’s consolidated gross revenue for that year or a family member serves in the current fiscal year or has served at any time during the last three fiscal years as an executive officer of the Company. The subjective test states that an independent director must be a person who lacks a relationship that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.

On December 6, 2019, Dalrada, via its wholly owned subsidiary, Dalrada Precision, acquired, by stock exchange agreement, 100% of Likido Ltd. (HQ) ( Likido ) in exchange of 6,118,000 shares of the Company s common stock. Likido, a United Kingdom company, is based in Edinburgh, Scotland. Likido is an international technology company developing advanced solutions for the harvesting and recycling of energy.

In connection with the purchase of Likido, the Company invested cash consideration of $600,000 (see Note 3). On January 9, 2020, Dalrada purchased seventy two percent (72%) of the issued and outstanding common equity shares of Prakat Solutions Inc. a Texas corporation, ( Prakat ). The purchase was made by means of a Stock Purchase Agreement ( SPA ). The consideration for the share purchase was three million six hundred thousand, (3,600,000) common equity shares of DFCO. Prakat has a wholly owned subsidiary based in India, Prakat Solutions Private Limited, which provides global customers with software and technology solutions specializing in Test Engineering, Accessibility Engineering, Product Engineering and Application Modernization. The Prakat India team provides end to end Product Engineering services across various domains, including Banking Financial Services, Telecom, Retail, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Legal and IT Infrastructure. Prakat India is an ISO 9001 Certified Company. The Company is still determining the impact of this transaction on the financial statements including the purchase price and the allocation of such (see Note 3). On or about March 23, 2020 Dalrada Health Products Corporation acquired One Hundred percent (100%) of the ownership of Shark. Shark is a cleaning solutions provider using electrostatic machines to spray and deodorize residential spaces, healthcare facilities, hospitality, transportation, manufacturing, automotive, systems, and other facilities requiring cleaning services. Through the acquisition of Shark, Dalrada Health Products developed the GlanHealth Brand (dba of Dalrada Health Products Corporation) to distribute alcohol-free hand sanitizers, surface cleaners, laundry aides, antimicrobial solutions, electrostatic sprayers, face masks, gloves, kits, and delivery equipment such as dispensers, stands, and ease of use packaging for the end consumer. GlanHealth leverages an extensive supply chain of producers, resellers, distributors, vendors, and formulators for the development, sale, and marketing of its products and services. On January 29, 2021, Dalrada Health entered into a stock purchase agreement and acquired one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding shares of International Health Group, Inc., a California corporation ( IHG ). The purchase price consideration is 1,000,000 common shares of DFCO, with no shares to be released upon closing and 1,000,000 shares released quarterly over the course of twenty-four months beginning on April 1, 2021. IHG provides highly trained nursing and medical assistants for hospitals and home health facilities since 2006. IHG Medical Assistant programs include CNA ( Certified Nursing Assistant ) and HHA ( Home Health Aide ) training and the fast-track 22-Day CNA Certification Program at its state-approved testing facility. On February 3, 2021, Dalrada Health entered into a unit purchase agreement and acquired one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding membership units of Pacific Stem Cells, LLC, a California limited liability company ( Pacific Stem ). The purchase price consideration is approximately $352,000 in cash and 1,000,000 common shares of DFCO, with 300,000 shares to be released upon closing and the remaining 700,000 shares released quarterly over the course of twenty-four months. Pacific Stem provides regenerative therapy as a potential solution for the prevention, detection, and treatment of cellular breakdown associated with aging and a variety of other conditions. On April 21, 2021, the Company closed the transaction by moving into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement to acquire Ignite IT LLC ( Ignite ). The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests, including business plans and access to contacts of Ignite. In consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued a promissory note for $20,000. In June 2021, the Company launched Empower Genomics ( Empower ) to enter the genetic testing industry. Empower facilitates the manufacturing, filing, labeling, testing and reporting of genetics. The Company's principal executive offices are located at 600 La Terraza Blvd., Escondido, California 92025. Going Concern These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As at June 30, 2021, the Company had a working capital deficit of $15,623,863 and an accumulated deficit of $107,338,174. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the successful financing through equity and/or debt investors and growing the subsidiaries anticipated to be profitable while reducing investments in areas that are not expected to have long-term benefits. The Company anticipates an increase in sales through the commercialization of the Likido heating and cooling units, the expansion of Prakat s technology services, IHG s increased educational footprint, additional GlanHealth sales channels and other new business opportunities (see Subsequent Events ). These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 4.

The total balance for accrued payroll taxes has accumulated on a quarterly basis beginning on their respective quarterly filing dates. Accrued interest is compounded daily at an estimated effective interest rate of 7.33%. The quarterly sub-totals that make up the $1,953,024 balance have a calculated expiration date of 10 years according to the Internal Revenue Service statute of limitations. As the tax periods surpass their estimated expiration date, the Company removes the liability from the consolidated balance sheets, and an equivalent amount is recognized as Gain on expiration of accrued tax liability within other income on the consolidated statements of operations. For fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $491,953 and $768,361, respectively, of penalties and interest within interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. For fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $9,054,041 and $1,229,199 respectively, within Gain on expiration of accrued tax liability as a result of quarterly tax liabilities that expired during the fiscal years. The amount owing may be subject to additional late filing fees and penalties that are not quantifiable as at the date of these consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Company periodically reviews the historical filings in determining if the statute has been paused or extended by the Internal Revenue Service. 7.

On June 30, 2019, the Company issued note agreement which included a conversion feature of the outstanding balance at $0.034 per share. As the conversion price was equal to the fair value of the common shares on the date of the agreement, there was no beneficial conversion feature. As of June 30, 2021 the principal balance was $1,875,000 and the accrued interest was $112,500. 9.

The Company s fiscal year end is June 30. (b) Principles of Consolidation These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Dalrada Precision, a company incorporated in the State of California, since June 25, 2018 (date of incorporation), Dalrada Health, a company incorporated in the State of California, since October 2, 2018 (date of incorporation), as well as its subsidiaries (Likido, Prakat, Shark, IHG, Pacific Stem, Ignite, Empower) since their respective acquisition dates (see Note 3). All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation. (c) Use of Estimates The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the valuation of inventory, valuation of accrued payroll tax liabilities, valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, variables used in the computation of share-based compensation, and evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. (d) Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. (e) Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company generally maintains balances in various operating accounts at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality, in amounts that may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to its cash and cash equivalents and does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. During the year ended June 30, 2021, there were no customers whose revenues accounted for 10% or greater of total revenues. During the year ended June 30, 2020, two customers accounted for approximately 16% and 11% of total revenues, respectively. (f) Fair Value Measurements Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Level 3 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, notes payable, and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on Level 1 inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations. (g) Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are derived from products and services delivered to customers and are stated at their net realizable value. Each month, the Company reviews its receivables on a basis and evaluates whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary based on any known or perceived collection issues. Any balances that are eventually deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had an allowance of doubtful accounts of $37,465 and $0, respectively. (h) Inventory Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in first-out basis. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, inventory is comprised of raw materials purchased from suppliers, and finished goods produced or purchased for resale. The Company establishes inventory reserves for estimated obsolete or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future market conditions. (i) Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset, as follows: Estimated Useful Life Computer and office equipment 3 - 5 years Machinery and equipment 5 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of lease term or useful life Estimated useful lives are periodically assessed to determine if changes are appropriate. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of these assets and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the balance sheet and any resulting gains or losses are included in the statement of operations loss in the period of disposal. (j) Business Combinations and Acquisitions The Company accounts for acquisitions in which it obtains control of one or more businesses as a business combination. The purchase price of the acquired businesses is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recognized as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments, in the period in which they are determined, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. If the assets acquired are not a business, the Company accounts for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, the Company recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. In addition, for transactions that are business combinations, the Company evaluates the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. (k) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews its long-lived assets (property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill is tested annually at June 30 for impairment and upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The annual goodwill impairment test allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. An entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to step one of the quantitative impairment test. If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of a reporting unit is, more likely than not, less than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is required. The quantitative impairment test calculates any goodwill impairment as the difference between the carrying amount of a reporting unit and its fair value, but not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. As of June 30, 2021, there were qualitative factors that indicated goodwill was impaired, but after completing the quantitative assessment it was determined that goodwill did not need to be impaired. An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. Separable assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, etc. Examples of intangible assets include computer software, licenses, trademarks, patents, films and copyrights. The Company s intangible assets are finite lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. (m) Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of inventory sold and related freight for product sales and direct labor for information technology and consulting services. The following table is a breakdown of cost of revenue: June 30, 2021 2020 Product sales $1,331,329 $268,526 Service revenue 1,140,637 357,390 Total cost of revenue $2,471,966 $625,916 (n) Advertising Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, advertising expenses were approximately $563,907 and $34,000, respectively. (o) Stock-based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the quoted market price of the equity instruments issued. During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, stock-based compensation expenses were approximately $801,672 and $0, respectively. (p) Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar. The functional currency of the Likido subsidiary is the British pound. The functional currency of Prakat is the Indian rupee. The financial statements of the Company s subsidiaries were translated to United States dollars in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Translation Matters, using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the year for revenues and expenses. Gains and losses arising on foreign currency denominated transactions are included in condensed consolidated statements of operations. (q) Comprehensive Income (Loss) ASC 220, Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the condensed consolidated financial statements. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company s only component of comprehensive income was foreign currency translation adjustments. (r) Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the periods using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the periods is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. The weighted average number of common stock equivalents related to convertible notes payable of 56,801,471 shares was not included in diluted loss per share, because the effects are antidilutive, for the year ended June 30, 2020. In accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share , the following table reconciles basic shares outstanding to fully diluted shares outstanding for the year ended June 30, 2021: Year Ended June 30, 2021 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Basic 70,318,073 Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents (convertible note payable - related party and accrued interest) 58,628,294 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Diluted 128,946,367 The adjustments to the numerator were insignificant during the year ended June 30, 2021 and there were no adjustments to the numerator during the year ended June 30, 2020. (s) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. (t) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in this Update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this pronouncement on July 1, 2020, and there was not a material impact on the financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity, as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity, and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the if-converted method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Company s current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2020-06 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures. The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities. The tax years ending 2018 through 2020 remain subject to examination for federal tax purposes and remain subject to examination in significant state tax jurisdictions. The Company has yet to file their income tax return for the year ended June 30, 2021 As of June 30, 2021, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of $20,036,664 that may be offset against future taxable income which will begin to expire in 2038 through 2041. The reconciliation of income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the income tax provision for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: 2021 2020 Current: Federal $ $ State 2,400 Foreign 2,400 Deferred: Federal (1,607,556) (522,084) State (446,626) (145,050) (2,054,182) (667,134) Valuation allowance 2,054,182 667,134 Total provision for income taxes $2,400 $ The provision for income tax for the year ended June 30, 2021 is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of: (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes; and (b) operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. Significant components of deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: 2021 2020 Depreciation Amortization $1,521 $450 Reserves and Accruals 250,907 118,071 Net Operating Loss Carryforwards 2,688,360 768,085 Gross Deferred Tax Assets 2,940,788 886,606 Valuation Allowance (2,940,788) (886,606) Net Deferred Tax Assets $ $ Reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax to the Company's effective tax: 2021 2020 Tax at Federal Statutory Rate 21.0 % 21.0 % State, Net of Federal Benefit (36,423)% 5.9 % Payroll Tax Interest (155,721)% 10.5 % Gain on Expiration of Accrued Tax Liability 10,224 % (6.6)% Stock Based Compensation 13,788% (3.7)% Change in Tax Rate (168,111)% 0.0 % Change in Valuation Allowance 168,522 % (27.0)% Provision for Taxes 196.6 % 0.0 % The difference in the effective rate and the statutory rate is due to permanent differences, primarily deductibility of penalties and interest on accrued payroll tax liabilities and the gains related to the expiration of the statute of limitations for accrued payroll tax liabilities. 801673 93000 78479 0 83606 46602 2020-06-25 2022-06-25 2500 2023-06-01 98409 417237 0.0448 0.44 0.354 0.576 0.0450 0.0310 0.045 361420 3000000 500000 172800 22500 4500000 1000000 0.47 0.43 430027 358354 P10Y P5Y P3Y 1221 -2477557 -15138435 342324 91904874 -107429607 -13407388 369194 92965821 -107338174 50 50 -7897 32287 -38391 51821 -13635643 241406 601825 91086179 -104963229 93217 415817 356235 352237 300945 195412 1247673 75931 -30000 0 35120 74202 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ) and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company s fiscal year end is June 30. (b) Principles of Consolidation These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Dalrada Precision, a company incorporated in the State of California, since June 25, 2018 (date of incorporation), Dalrada Health, a company incorporated in the State of California, since October 2, 2018 (date of incorporation), as well as its subsidiaries (Likido, Prakat, Shark, IHG, Pacific Stem, Ignite, Empower) since their respective acquisition dates (see Note 3). All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation. (c) Use of Estimates The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the valuation of inventory, valuation of accrued payroll tax liabilities, valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, variables used in the computation of share-based compensation, and evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. (d) Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. (e) Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company generally maintains balances in various operating accounts at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality, in amounts that may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to its cash and cash equivalents and does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. During the year ended June 30, 2021, there were no customers whose revenues accounted for 10% or greater of total revenues. During the year ended June 30, 2020, two customers accounted for approximately 16% and 11% of total revenues, respectively. (f) Fair Value Measurements Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Level 3 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, notes payable, and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on Level 1 inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations. (g) Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are derived from products and services delivered to customers and are stated at their net realizable value. Each month, the Company reviews its receivables on a basis and evaluates whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary based on any known or perceived collection issues. Any balances that are eventually deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had an allowance of doubtful accounts of $37,465 and $0, respectively. (h) Inventory Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in first-out basis. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, inventory is comprised of raw materials purchased from suppliers, and finished goods produced or purchased for resale. The Company establishes inventory reserves for estimated obsolete or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future market conditions. (i) Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset, as follows: Estimated Useful Life Computer and office equipment 3 - 5 years Machinery and equipment 5 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of lease term or useful life Estimated useful lives are periodically assessed to determine if changes are appropriate. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of these assets and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the balance sheet and any resulting gains or losses are included in the statement of operations loss in the period of disposal. (j) Business Combinations and Acquisitions The Company accounts for acquisitions in which it obtains control of one or more businesses as a business combination. The purchase price of the acquired businesses is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recognized as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments, in the period in which they are determined, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. If the assets acquired are not a business, the Company accounts for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, the Company recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. In addition, for transactions that are business combinations, the Company evaluates the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. (k) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews its long-lived assets (property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill is tested annually at June 30 for impairment and upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The annual goodwill impairment test allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. An entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to step one of the quantitative impairment test. If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of a reporting unit is, more likely than not, less than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is required. The quantitative impairment test calculates any goodwill impairment as the difference between the carrying amount of a reporting unit and its fair value, but not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. As of June 30, 2021, there were qualitative factors that indicated goodwill was impaired, but after completing the quantitative assessment it was determined that goodwill did not need to be impaired. An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. Separable assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, etc. Examples of intangible assets include computer software, licenses, trademarks, patents, films and copyrights. The Company s intangible assets are finite lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. (l) Revenue Recognition The Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and its related amendments (collectively known as ASC 606 ), effective January 1, 2019. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: - Identification of a contract with a customer; - Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; - Determination of the transaction price; - Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and - Recognition of revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. The Company s revenue is derived from the sales of its products, which represents net sales recorded in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. Product sales are recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with the customer are satisfied. Typically, this would occur upon transfer of control, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods. The Company measures revenue as the amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods (transaction price). The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. The Company bases its estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns, markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by the Company. The actual amount of customer returns and allowances is inherently uncertain and may differ from the Company s estimates. If the Company determines that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves it established, it would record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period in which it makes such a determination. Reserves for returns, and markdowns are included within accrued expenses and other liabilities. Allowance and discounts are recorded in accounts receivable, net and the value of inventory associated with reserves for sales returns are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company estimates warranty claims reserves based on historical results and research and determined that a warranty reserve was not necessary as of June 30, 2021 or 2020. The Company also earns service revenue from its other subsidiaries, including information technology and consulting services via Prakat, educational programs and courses via IHG, and stem cell therapy procedures from Pacific Stems. For Prakat and Pacific Stems, revenues are recognized when performance obligations have been satisfied and the services are complete. This is generally at a point of time upon written completion and client acceptance of the project, which represents transfer of control to the customer. For IHG, revenues are recognized over the course of a semester while services are performed. During the fiscal year, the Company sold Likido units to its third-party manufacturer for testing purposes and for further resale to their customers. As of June 30, 2021, the Company changed its relationship exclusively to that of a third-party manufacturer and requested the title of inventory to be returned and adjusted the revenue accordingly. Deferred Revenue: ASC 606 requires disclosure of the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period and an explanation of when the entity expects to recognize revenue by either a quantitative basis or a qualitative basis. Deferred revenue for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $219,999 compared to $176,291 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The current year balance of $219,999 consists of deliverables from the following entities: $140,199 for IHG, $59,800 for Precision, and $20,000 for Prakat USA. It is anticipated that these products will be delivered during the first quarter of 2022. The prior year balance of $176,291 was for Likido products. Disaggregation of Revenue The following table presents the Company's revenue disaggregated by revenue source: Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 Product sales - third parties $1,053,720 $466,946 Product sales - related party 62,607 124,427 Service revenue - third parties 2,020,307 487,642 Service revenue - related party 270,050 99,139 Total revenue $3,406,684 $1,178,154 Contract Balances The following table provides information about receivables and contract liabilities from contracts with customers: June 30, 2021 2020 Accounts receivable, net $265,812 $229,167 Accounts receivable, net - related parties 69,952 99,357 Deferred revenue 219,999 176,291 The Company invoices customers based upon contractual billing schedules, and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent a set-up fee prepayment received from a customer in advance of performance obligations met. (m) Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of inventory sold and related freight for product sales and direct labor for information technology and consulting services. The following table is a breakdown of cost of revenue: June 30, 2021 2020 Product sales $1,331,329 $268,526 Service revenue 1,140,637 357,390 Total cost of revenue $2,471,966 $625,916 (n) Advertising Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, advertising expenses were approximately $563,907 and $34,000, respectively. (o) Stock-based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the quoted market price of the equity instruments issued. During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, stock-based compensation expenses were approximately $801,672 and $0, respectively. (p) Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar. The functional currency of the Likido subsidiary is the British pound. The functional currency of Prakat is the Indian rupee. The financial statements of the Company s subsidiaries were translated to United States dollars in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Translation Matters, using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the year for revenues and expenses. Gains and losses arising on foreign currency denominated transactions are included in condensed consolidated statements of operations. (q) Comprehensive Income (Loss) ASC 220, Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the condensed consolidated financial statements. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company s only component of comprehensive income was foreign currency translation adjustments. (r) Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the periods using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the periods is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. The weighted average number of common stock equivalents related to convertible notes payable of 56,801,471 shares was not included in diluted loss per share, because the effects are antidilutive, for the year ended June 30, 2020. In accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share , the following table reconciles basic shares outstanding to fully diluted shares outstanding for the year ended June 30, 2021: Year Ended June 30, 2021 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Basic 70,318,073 Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents (convertible note payable - related party and accrued interest) 58,628,294 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Diluted 128,946,367 The adjustments to the numerator were insignificant during the year ended June 30, 2021 and there were no adjustments to the numerator during the year ended June 30, 2020. (s) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. (t) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in this Update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this pronouncement on July 1, 2020, and there was not a material impact on the financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity, as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity, and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the if-converted method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Company s current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2020-06 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures. The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

Commitments and Contingencies Lease Commitments The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. This determination generally depends on whether the arrangement conveys to the Company the right to control the use of an explicitly or implicitly identified fixed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control of an underlying asset is conveyed to the Company if the Company obtains the rights to direct the use of and to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from using the underlying asset. The Company has lease agreements which include lease and non-lease components, which the Company has elected to account for as a single lease component for all classes of underlying assets. Lease expense for variable lease components is recognized when the obligation is probable. Operating lease right of use ( ROU ) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company primarily leases buildings (real estate) which are classified as operating leases. ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As an implicit interest rate is not readily determinable in the Company's leases, the incremental borrowing rate is used based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The lease term for all of the Company's leases includes the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by the lessor. Options for lease renewals have been excluded from the lease term (and lease liability) for the majority of the Company's leases as the reasonably certain threshold is not met. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are comprised of fixed payments, variable payments that depend on index or rate, and amounts probable to be payable under the exercise of the Company option to purchase the underlying asset if reasonably certain. Variable lease payments not dependent on a rate or index associated with the Company's leases are recognized when the event, activity, or circumstance in the lease agreement on which those payments are assessed as probable. Variable lease payments are presented as operating expenses in the Company's income statement in the same line item as expense arising from fixed lease payments. As of and during the year ended June 30, 2021, management determined that there were no variable lease costs.

In connection with the purchase of Likido, the Company invested cash consideration of $600,000 (see Note 3). On January 9, 2020, Dalrada purchased seventy two percent (72%) of the issued and outstanding common equity shares of Prakat Solutions Inc. a Texas corporation, (“Prakat”). The purchase was made by means of a Stock Purchase Agreement (“SPA”). The consideration for the share purchase was three million six hundred thousand, (3,600,000) common equity shares of DFCO. Prakat has a wholly owned subsidiary based in India, Prakat Solutions Private Limited, which provides global customers with software and technology solutions specializing in Test Engineering, Accessibility Engineering, Product Engineering and Application Modernization. The Prakat India team provides end to end Product Engineering services across various domains, including – Banking & Financial Services, Telecom, Retail, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Legal and IT Infrastructure. Prakat India is an ISO 9001 Certified Company. The Company is still determining the impact of this transaction on the financial statements including the purchase price and the allocation of such (see Note 3). On or about March 23, 2020 Dalrada Health Products Corporation acquired One Hundred percent (100%) of the ownership of Shark. Shark is a cleaning solutions provider using electrostatic machines to spray and deodorize residential spaces, healthcare facilities, hospitality, transportation, manufacturing, automotive, systems, and other facilities requiring cleaning services. Through the acquisition of Shark, Dalrada Health Products developed the GlanHealth Brand (dba of Dalrada Health Products Corporation) to distribute alcohol-free hand sanitizers, surface cleaners, laundry aides, antimicrobial solutions, electrostatic sprayers, face masks, gloves, kits, and delivery equipment such as dispensers, stands, and ease of use packaging for the end consumer. GlanHealth leverages an extensive supply chain of producers, resellers, distributors, vendors, and formulators for the development, sale, and marketing of its products and services. On January 29, 2021, Dalrada Health entered into a stock purchase agreement and acquired one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding shares of International Health Group, Inc., a California corporation (“IHG”). The purchase price consideration is 1,000,000 common shares of DFCO, with no shares to be released upon closing and 1,000,000 shares released quarterly over the course of twenty-four months beginning on April 1, 2021. IHG provides highly trained nursing and medical assistants for hospitals and home health facilities since 2006. IHG Medical Assistant programs include CNA (“Certified Nursing Assistant”) and HHA (“Home Health Aide”) training and the fast-track 22-Day CNA Certification Program at its state-approved testing facility. On February 3, 2021, Dalrada Health entered into a unit purchase agreement and acquired one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding membership units of Pacific Stem Cells, LLC, a California limited liability company (“Pacific Stem”).

Pacific Stem provides regenerative therapy as a potential solution for the prevention, detection, and treatment of cellular breakdown associated with aging and a variety of other conditions. On April 21, 2021, the Company closed the transaction by moving into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement to acquire Ignite IT LLC (“Ignite”). The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests, including business plans and access to contacts of Ignite. In consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued a promissory note for $20,000. In June 2021, the Company launched Empower Genomics (“Empower”) to enter the genetic testing industry. Empower facilitates the manufacturing, filing, labeling, testing and reporting of genetics. The Company's principal executive offices are located at 600 La Terraza Blvd., Escondido, California 92025. Going Concern These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As at June 30, 2021, the Company had a working capital deficit of $15,623,863 and an accumulated deficit of $107,338,174. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the successful financing through equity and/or debt investors and growing the subsidiaries anticipated to be profitable while reducing investments in areas that are not expected to have long-term benefits. The Company anticipates an increase in sales through the commercialization of the Likido heating and cooling units, the expansion of Prakat’s technology services, IHG’s increased educational footprint, additional GlanHealth sales channels and other new business opportunities (see “Subsequent Events”). These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 12 Months Ended Jun. 30, 2021 Accounting Policies [Abstract] Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”) and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company’s fiscal year end is June 30. (b) Principles of Consolidation These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Dalrada Precision, a company incorporated in the State of California, since June 25, 2018 (date of incorporation), Dalrada Health, a company incorporated in the State of California, since October 2, 2018 (date of incorporation), as well as its subsidiaries (Likido, Prakat, Shark, IHG, Pacific Stem, Ignite, Empower) since their respective acquisition dates (see Note 3). All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation. (c) Use of Estimates The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the valuation of inventory, valuation of accrued payroll tax liabilities, valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, variables used in the computation of share-based compensation, and evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. (d) Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. (e) Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company generally maintains balances in various operating accounts at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality, in amounts that may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to its cash and cash equivalents and does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. During the year ended June 30, 2021, there were no customers whose revenues accounted for 10% or greater of total revenues. During the year ended June 30, 2020, two customers accounted for approximately 16% and 11% of total revenues, respectively. (f) Fair Value Measurements Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Level 3 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, notes payable, and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations. (g) Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are derived from products and services delivered to customers and are stated at their net realizable value. Each month, the Company reviews its receivables on a basis and evaluates whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary based on any known or perceived collection issues. Any balances that are eventually deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had an allowance of doubtful accounts of $37,465 and $0, respectively. (h) Inventory Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in first-out basis. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, inventory is comprised of raw materials purchased from suppliers, and finished goods produced or purchased for resale. The Company establishes inventory reserves for estimated obsolete or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future market conditions. (i) Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset, as follows: Estimated Useful Life Computer and office equipment 3 - 5 years Machinery and equipment 5 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of lease term or useful life Estimated useful lives are periodically assessed to determine if changes are appropriate. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of these assets and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the balance sheet and any resulting gains or losses are included in the statement of operations loss in the period of disposal. (j) Business Combinations and Acquisitions The Company accounts for acquisitions in which it obtains control of one or more businesses as a business combination. The purchase price of the acquired businesses is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recognized as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments, in the period in which they are determined, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. If the assets acquired are not a business, the Company accounts for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, the Company recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. In addition, for transactions that are business combinations, the Company evaluates the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. (k) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews its long-lived assets (property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill is tested annually at June 30 for impairment and upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The annual goodwill impairment test allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. An entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to step one of the quantitative impairment test. If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of a reporting unit is, more likely than not, less than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is required. The quantitative impairment test calculates any goodwill impairment as the difference between the carrying amount of a reporting unit and its fair value, but not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. As of June 30, 2021, there were qualitative factors that indicated goodwill was impaired, but after completing the quantitative assessment it was determined that goodwill did not need to be impaired. An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. Separable assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, etc. Examples of intangible assets include computer software, licenses, trademarks, patents, films and copyrights. The Company’s intangible assets are finite lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. (l) Revenue Recognition The Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , and its related amendments (collectively known as “ASC 606”), effective January 1, 2019. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: - Identification of a contract with a customer; - Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; - Determination of the transaction price; - Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and - Recognition of revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. The Company’s revenue is derived from the sales of its products, which represents net sales recorded in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. Product sales are recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with the customer are satisfied. Typically, this would occur upon transfer of control, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods. The Company measures revenue as the amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods (transaction price). The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. The Company bases its estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns, markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by the Company. The actual amount of customer returns and allowances is inherently uncertain and may differ from the Company’s estimates. If the Company determines that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves it established, it would record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period in which it makes such a determination. Reserves for returns, and markdowns are included within accrued expenses and other liabilities. Allowance and discounts are recorded in accounts receivable, net and the value of inventory associated with reserves for sales returns are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company estimates warranty claims reserves based on historical results and research and determined that a warranty reserve was not necessary as of June 30, 2021 or 2020. The Company also earns service revenue from its other subsidiaries, including information technology and consulting services via Prakat, educational programs and courses via IHG, and stem cell therapy procedures from Pacific Stems. For Prakat and Pacific Stems, revenues are recognized when performance obligations have been satisfied and the services are complete. This is generally at a point of time upon written completion and client acceptance of the project, which represents transfer of control to the customer. For IHG, revenues are recognized over the course of a semester while services are performed. During the fiscal year, the Company sold Likido units to its third-party manufacturer for testing purposes and for further resale to their customers. As of June 30, 2021, the Company changed its relationship exclusively to that of a third-party manufacturer and requested the title of inventory to be returned and adjusted the revenue accordingly. Deferred Revenue : ASC 606 requires disclosure of the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period and an explanation of when the entity expects to recognize revenue by either a quantitative basis or a qualitative basis. Deferred revenue for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $219,999 compared to $176,291 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The current year balance of $219,999 consists of deliverables from the following entities: $140,199 for IHG, $59,800 for Precision, and $20,000 for Prakat USA. It is anticipated that these products will be delivered during the first quarter of 2022. The prior year balance of $176,291 was for Likido products. Disaggregation of Revenue The following table presents the Company's revenue disaggregated by revenue source: Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 Product sales - third parties $ 1,053,720 $ 466,946 Product sales - related party 62,607 124,427 Service revenue - third parties 2,020,307 487,642 Service revenue - related party 270,050 99,139 Total revenue $ 3,406,684 $ 1,178,154 Contract Balances The following table provides information about receivables and contract liabilities from contracts with customers: June 30, 2021 2020 Accounts receivable, net $ 265,812 $ 229,167 Accounts receivable, net - related parties 69,952 99,357 Deferred revenue 219,999 176,291 The Company invoices customers based upon contractual billing schedules, and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent a set-up fee prepayment received from a customer in advance of performance obligations met. (m) Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of inventory sold and related freight for product sales and direct labor for information technology and consulting services. The following table is a breakdown of cost of revenue: June 30, 2021 2020 Product sales $ 1,331,329 $ 268,526 Service revenue 1,140,637 357,390 Total cost of revenue $ 2,471,966 $ 625,916 (n) Advertising Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, advertising expenses were approximately $563,907 and $34,000, respectively. (o) Stock-based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the quoted market price of the equity instruments issued. During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, stock-based compensation expenses were approximately $801,672 and $0, respectively. (p) Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar. The functional currency of the Likido subsidiary is the British pound. The functional currency of Prakat is the Indian rupee. The financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries were translated to United States dollars in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Translation Matters , using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the year for revenues and expenses. Gains and losses arising on foreign currency denominated transactions are included in condensed consolidated statements of operations. (q) Comprehensive Income (Loss) ASC 220, Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the condensed consolidated financial statements. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company’s only component of comprehensive income was foreign currency translation adjustments. (r) Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share . ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the periods using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the periods is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. The weighted average number of common stock equivalents related to convertible notes payable of 56,801,471 shares was not included in diluted loss per share, because the effects are antidilutive, for the year ended June 30, 2020. In accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share”, the following table reconciles basic shares outstanding to fully diluted shares outstanding for the year ended June 30, 2021: Year Ended June 30, 2021 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Basic 70,318,073 Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents (convertible note payable - related party and accrued interest) 58,628,294 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Diluted 128,946,367 The adjustments to the numerator were insignificant during the year ended June 30, 2021 and there were no adjustments to the numerator during the year ended June 30, 2020. (s) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes . The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. (t) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . The amendments in this Update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this pronouncement on July 1, 2020, and there was not a material impact on the financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity, and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the “if-converted” method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Company’s current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2020-06 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures. The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

The Company acquired IHG to expand into the educational sector of the Health and Human Services Industry. The International Health Group transaction was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). The Company has determined preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These values are subject to change as we perform additional reviews of our assumptions utilized.

Pursuant to the costs incurred over a ten-year period to develop the CNA and other curriculums, the Company has determined a minimum of a 10-year useful life is appropriate.

Commitments and Contingencies 12 Months Ended Jun. 30, 2021 Commitments and Contingencies Disclosure [Abstract] Commitments and Contingencies 12. Commitments and Contingencies Lease Commitments The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. This determination generally depends on whether the arrangement conveys to the Company the right to control the use of an explicitly or implicitly identified fixed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control of an underlying asset is conveyed to the Company if the Company obtains the rights to direct the use of and to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from using the underlying asset. The Company has lease agreements which include lease and non-lease components, which the Company has elected to account for as a single lease component for all classes of underlying assets. Lease expense for variable lease components is recognized when the obligation is probable. Operating lease right of use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company primarily leases buildings (real estate) which are classified as operating leases. ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As an implicit interest rate is not readily determinable in the Company's leases, the incremental borrowing rate is used based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The lease term for all of the Company's leases includes the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by the lessor. Options for lease renewals have been excluded from the lease term (and lease liability) for the majority of the Company's leases as the reasonably certain threshold is not met. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are comprised of fixed payments, variable payments that depend on index or rate, and amounts probable to be payable under the exercise of the Company option to purchase the underlying asset if reasonably certain. Variable lease payments not dependent on a rate or index associated with the Company's leases are recognized when the event, activity, or circumstance in the lease agreement on which those payments are assessed as probable. Variable lease payments are presented as operating expenses in the Company's income statement in the same line item as expense arising from fixed lease payments. As of and during the year ended June 30, 2021, management determined that there were no variable lease costs. Right of Use Asset In May 2020, the Company entered into a five-year lease agreement to lease a commercial building in Escondido, California. The building is owned by a related party.

The Company has yet to file their income tax return for the year ended June 30, 2021 As of June 30, 2021, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of $20,036,664 that may be offset against future taxable income which will begin to expire in 2038 through 2041. The reconciliation of income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the income tax provision for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: 2021 2020 Current: Federal $ – $ – State 2,400 – Foreign – – 2,400 – Deferred: Federal (1,607,556 ) (522,084 ) State (446,626 ) (145,050 ) (2,054,182 ) (667,134 ) Valuation allowance 2,054,182 667,134 Total provision for income taxes $ 2,400 $ – The provision for income tax for the year ended June 30, 2021 is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of: (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes; and (b) operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. Significant components of deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: 2021 2020 Depreciation & Amortization $ 1,521 $ 450 Reserves and Accruals 250,907 118,071 Net Operating Loss Carryforwards 2,688,360 768,085 Gross Deferred Tax Assets 2,940,788 886,606 Valuation Allowance (2,940,788 ) (886,606 ) Net Deferred Tax Assets $ – $ – Reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax to the Company's effective tax: 2021 2020 Tax at Federal Statutory Rate 21.0 % 21.0 % State, Net of Federal Benefit (36,423)% 5.9 % Payroll Tax Interest (155,721)% 10.5 % Gain on Expiration of Accrued Tax Liability 10,224 % (6.6)% Stock Based Compensation 13,788% (3.7)% Change in Tax Rate (168,111)% 0.0 % Change in Valuation Allowance 168,522 % (27.0)% Provision for Taxes 196.6 % 0.0 % The difference in the effective rate and the statutory rate is due to permanent differences, primarily deductibility of penalties and interest on accrued payroll tax liabilities and the gains related to the expiration of the statute of limitations for accrued payroll tax liabilities.

On August 16, 2021, the company issued an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of common stock to four new directors pursuant to Amendment No.1 of the 2020 Stock Compensation Plan used to compensate the company board of directors. The Amended plan allocates the issuance of up to 6,500,000 shares. The 2,000,000 shares issued are valued at $0.28 per share or Fair Value of $560,000. In July 2021, Dalrada, through its subsidiary Dalrada Health, expanded its presence in medical services sector by establishing Sòlas Rejuvenation + Wellness (“Solas”) which provides medically backed services, and creates overall wellness programs that are customized to the unique needs of its clients. Solas will be opening its first health services location in October 2021 where it will provide a myriad of health and wellness treatments and procedures. In August 2021, Dalrada, through its subsidiary Dalrada Health, entered into a joint venture ("JV") with Vivera Inc ("Vivera") for a 51% ownership. The JV, Pala Diagnostics, LLC ("Pala") is a CLIA-certified diagnostics lab focused on SARS-CoV-2 testing for now with additional testing capabilities to be introduced. Pursuant to the partnership agreement, Dalrada had an equity commitment of $500,000 of which it achieved during September 2021. Dalrada has invested additional funding to continue the expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 testing while commercial insurance and CARES Act reimbursements process claims. Since fiscal year-end, Pala has conducted over 25,000 tests. Pursuant to the JV, Dalrada shall also issue two hundred and fifty thousand common shares (250,000) to Vivera. Subsequent to year-end, the Company borrowed $366,263 from Related Entity 1, and $2,206,718 from Related Entity 3 .

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Policies) 12 Months Ended Jun. 30, 2021 Accounting Policies [Abstract] Basis of Presentation (a) Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”) and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company’s fiscal year end is June 30. Principles of Consolidation (b) Principles of Consolidation These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Dalrada Precision, a company incorporated in the State of California, since June 25, 2018 (date of incorporation), Dalrada Health, a company incorporated in the State of California, since October 2, 2018 (date of incorporation), as well as its subsidiaries (Likido, Prakat, Shark, IHG, Pacific Stem, Ignite, Empower) since their respective acquisition dates (see Note 3). All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation. Use of Estimates (c) Use of Estimates The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the valuation of inventory, valuation of accrued payroll tax liabilities, valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, variables used in the computation of share-based compensation, and evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. Cash and Cash Equivalents (d) Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. Concentrations of Credit Risk (e) Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company generally maintains balances in various operating accounts at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality, in amounts that may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to its cash and cash equivalents and does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. During the year ended June 30, 2021, there were no customers whose revenues accounted for 10% or greater of total revenues. During the year ended June 30, 2020, two customers accounted for approximately 16% and 11% of total revenues, respectively. Fair Value Measurements (f) Fair Value Measurements Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Level 3 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, notes payable, and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations. Accounts Receivable (g) Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are derived from products and services delivered to customers and are stated at their net realizable value. Each month, the Company reviews its receivables on a basis and evaluates whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary based on any known or perceived collection issues. Any balances that are eventually deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had an allowance of doubtful accounts of $37,465 and $0, respectively. Inventory (h) Inventory Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in first-out basis. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, inventory is comprised of raw materials purchased from suppliers, and finished goods produced or purchased for resale. The Company establishes inventory reserves for estimated obsolete or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future market conditions. Property and Equipment (i) Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset, as follows: Estimated Useful Life Computer and office equipment 3 - 5 years Machinery and equipment 5 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of lease term or useful life Estimated useful lives are periodically assessed to determine if changes are appropriate. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of these assets and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the balance sheet and any resulting gains or losses are included in the statement of operations loss in the period of disposal. Business Combinations and Acquisitions (j) Business Combinations and Acquisitions The Company accounts for acquisitions in which it obtains control of one or more businesses as a business combination. The purchase price of the acquired businesses is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recognized as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments, in the period in which they are determined, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. If the assets acquired are not a business, the Company accounts for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, the Company recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. In addition, for transactions that are business combinations, the Company evaluates the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (k) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews its long-lived assets (property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill is tested annually at June 30 for impairment and upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The annual goodwill impairment test allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. An entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to step one of the quantitative impairment test. If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of a reporting unit is, more likely than not, less than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is required. The quantitative impairment test calculates any goodwill impairment as the difference between the carrying amount of a reporting unit and its fair value, but not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. As of June 30, 2021, there were qualitative factors that indicated goodwill was impaired, but after completing the quantitative assessment it was determined that goodwill did not need to be impaired. An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. Separable assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, etc. Examples of intangible assets include computer software, licenses, trademarks, patents, films and copyrights. The Company’s intangible assets are finite lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Revenue Recognition (l) Revenue Recognition The Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , and its related amendments (collectively known as “ASC 606”), effective January 1, 2019. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: - Identification of a contract with a customer; - Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; - Determination of the transaction price; - Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and - Recognition of revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. The Company’s revenue is derived from the sales of its products, which represents net sales recorded in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. Product sales are recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with the customer are satisfied. Typically, this would occur upon transfer of control, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods. The Company measures revenue as the amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods (transaction price). The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. The Company bases its estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns, markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by the Company. The actual amount of customer returns and allowances is inherently uncertain and may differ from the Company’s estimates. If the Company determines that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves it established, it would record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period in which it makes such a determination. Reserves for returns, and markdowns are included within accrued expenses and other liabilities. Allowance and discounts are recorded in accounts receivable, net and the value of inventory associated with reserves for sales returns are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company estimates warranty claims reserves based on historical results and research and determined that a warranty reserve was not necessary as of June 30, 2021 or 2020. The Company also earns service revenue from its other subsidiaries, including information technology and consulting services via Prakat, educational programs and courses via IHG, and stem cell therapy procedures from Pacific Stems. For Prakat and Pacific Stems, revenues are recognized when performance obligations have been satisfied and the services are complete. This is generally at a point of time upon written completion and client acceptance of the project, which represents transfer of control to the customer. For IHG, revenues are recognized over the course of a semester while services are performed. During the fiscal year, the Company sold Likido units to its third-party manufacturer for testing purposes and for further resale to their customers. As of June 30, 2021, the Company changed its relationship exclusively to that of a third-party manufacturer and requested the title of inventory to be returned and adjusted the revenue accordingly. Deferred Revenue : ASC 606 requires disclosure of the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period and an explanation of when the entity expects to recognize revenue by either a quantitative basis or a qualitative basis. Deferred revenue for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $219,999 compared to $176,291 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The current year balance of $219,999 consists of deliverables from the following entities: $140,199 for IHG, $59,800 for Precision, and $20,000 for Prakat USA. It is anticipated that these products will be delivered during the first quarter of 2022. The prior year balance of $176,291 was for Likido products. Disaggregation of Revenue The following table presents the Company's revenue disaggregated by revenue source: Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 Product sales - third parties $ 1,053,720 $ 466,946 Product sales - related party 62,607 124,427 Service revenue - third parties 2,020,307 487,642 Service revenue - related party 270,050 99,139 Total revenue $ 3,406,684 $ 1,178,154 Contract Balances The following table provides information about receivables and contract liabilities from contracts with customers: June 30, 2021 2020 Accounts receivable, net $ 265,812 $ 229,167 Accounts receivable, net - related parties 69,952 99,357 Deferred revenue 219,999 176,291 The Company invoices customers based upon contractual billing schedules, and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent a set-up fee prepayment received from a customer in advance of performance obligations met. Cost of Revenue (m) Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of inventory sold and related freight for product sales and direct labor for information technology and consulting services. The following table is a breakdown of cost of revenue: June 30, 2021 2020 Product sales $ 1,331,329 $ 268,526 Service revenue 1,140,637 357,390 Total cost of revenue $ 2,471,966 $ 625,916 Advertising (n) Advertising Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, advertising expenses were approximately $563,907 and $34,000, respectively. Stock-based Compensation (o) Stock-based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the quoted market price of the equity instruments issued. During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, stock-based compensation expenses were approximately $801,672 and $0, respectively. Foreign Currency Translation (p) Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar. The functional currency of the Likido subsidiary is the British pound. The functional currency of Prakat is the Indian rupee. The financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries were translated to United States dollars in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Translation Matters , using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the year for revenues and expenses. Gains and losses arising on foreign currency denominated transactions are included in condensed consolidated statements of operations. Comprehensive Income (Loss) (q) Comprehensive Income (Loss) ASC 220, Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the condensed consolidated financial statements. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company’s only component of comprehensive income was foreign currency translation adjustments. Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share (r) Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share . ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the periods using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the periods is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. The weighted average number of common stock equivalents related to convertible notes payable of 56,801,471 shares was not included in diluted loss per share, because the effects are antidilutive, for the year ended June 30, 2020. In accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share”, the following table reconciles basic shares outstanding to fully diluted shares outstanding for the year ended June 30, 2021: Year Ended June 30, 2021 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Basic 70,318,073 Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents (convertible note payable - related party and accrued interest) 58,628,294 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Diluted 128,946,367 The adjustments to the numerator were insignificant during the year ended June 30, 2021 and there were no adjustments to the numerator during the year ended June 30, 2020. Income Taxes (s) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes . The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. Recent Accounting Pronouncements (t) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . The amendments in this Update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this pronouncement on July 1, 2020, and there was not a material impact on the financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity, and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the “if-converted” method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Company’s current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2020-06 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures. The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
